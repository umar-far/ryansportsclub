Afridi made his ODI debut in 1996, his Test debut in 1998 and his T20I debut in 2006. Afridi was player of the match in the final of the 2009 T20 World Cup scoring an unbeaten 54, having also been the player of the tournament in the 2007 edition. He led the Pakistan team in the 2011 Cricket World Cup where they reached the semi-finals before losing to rival India. In tests, Afridi was captain for just one match before resigning and retiring from the format, a move which allowed Salman Butt to replace him. After Pakistan's group stage elimination from the 2016 T20 World Cup, Afridi stepped down from captaincy. He was not selected afterwards and on 19 February 2017, Afridi announced his retirement from international cricket. He made a brief return to international cricket after being selected to represent and captain the World XI against the West Indies in the 2018 Hurricane Relief T20 Challenge charity match. Following the conclusion of the match, Afridi announced his retirement from international cricket on 31 May 2018.
